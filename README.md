# meet-the-strangers
This is an application with features of direct calls where we can establish a connection between two users by passing our personal code or we can just connect with the stranger.
In this application, I have used 
*WebRTC
*SocketIO
*Express.js
*Node.js
*Vanilla JavaScript to create front-end of our application
