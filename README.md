# meet-the-strangers
This is an application with features of direct calls where we can establish a connection between two users by passing our personal code or we can just connect with the stranger.\
In this application, I have used
1. WebRTC 
2. SocketIO 
3. Express.js 
4. Node.js 
5. Vanilla JavaScript to create front end of our application
